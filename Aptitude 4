 Q: Find out all possible values of a & b for which the ratio of a^3+b^3 to a^3-b^3 is 1:1 a,b are real numbers.
Ans:
Let's write the given ratio as an equation:
(a^3 + b^3) / (a^3 - b^3) = 1/1

Cross-multiplying, we get:
a^3 + b^3 = a^3 - b^3

Subtracting a^3 from both sides gives:
b^3 = -b^3

Dividing both sides by -1 gives:
b^3 = 0

This implies that b = 0.
Now, substituting b = 0 into the original equation, we get:
(a^3 + 0) / (a^3 - 0) = 1/1
a^3 / a^3 = 1/1
1 = 1
This is true for any non-zero value of a.

So, the possible values of a and b are:
a â‰  0, b = 0
In other words, a can be any non-zero real number, and b must be 0.
